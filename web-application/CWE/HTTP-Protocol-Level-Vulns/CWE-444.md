## CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request/Response Smuggling')


### Definition
This vulnerability arises when a web server or proxy interprets an HTTP request differently from the intended backend server due to inconsistencies in parsing the request. This discrepancy can allow an attacker to inject malicious payloads, leading to various exploits, such as unauthorized access, information disclosure, or request hijacking. It typically occurs when HTTP headers, such as `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`, are improperly validated or misinterpreted.

### Key Reasons Behind CWE-444 Vulnerability:
1. **Inconsistent Parsing of HTTP Requests:** Differences in how HTTP requests are interpreted between front-end proxies and back-end servers, often caused by conflicting interpretations of headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
2. **Lack of Strict Header Validation:** The application fails to validate or normalize critical headers, allowing attackers to craft malicious payloads that manipulate request handling.
3. **Improper Configuration of Web Servers and Proxies:** Misconfigured servers or load balancers that allow overlapping or ambiguous HTTP requests to pass through without proper scrutiny.


### Steps of test this CWE:
1. Http Request Testing
> how the server is processed for parameters in the request head (Headers) such as: `Content-Length` , `Transfer-Encoding`
2. Parsing Differences
> For example: 
```
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
Content-Length: 20  
```

3. Crafted Requests
> Send a request with a payload like:
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1  
Host: victim.com  
Content-Length: 4  
Transfer-Encoding: chunked  

0  

GET /malicious HTTP/1.1  
```
4. Exploit -> PoC ðŸŽ‰ 
### Impact
- Gain access to protected resources, such as admin consoles
- Gain access to sensitive data
- Hijack sessions of web users
- Launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks without requiring any action from the user
- Perform credential hijacking


### Techniques Prevention:
Validate HTTP Headers
> Strictly validate critical headers like `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.


**Enforce HTTP/2 or HTTPS:**
> Shift to HTTP/2, which inherently avoids request smuggling issues, or ensure strict handling in HTTPS environments.
